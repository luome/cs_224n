# cs_224n_code
This is a repository that uses PyTorch to implement the algorithms in Stanford cs224n courses.


See the [DSKSD's repo](https://github.com/DSKSD/DeepNLP-models-Pytorch) for more infomation.The reason why I didn't simply folk that repo is that I want to use torch 0.4 and I don't wanna use Jupyter notebook.

 - python 3.6.5
 - torch 0.4.1
